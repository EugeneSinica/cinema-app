# ðŸ”´ Cinema App

This project uses the most popular modern Java frameworks an also supports REST principles.

The main goal of the app is to create a user, let the user make order (buy tickets)
to a certain movie session in a certain cinema hall.

By default, the app has two roles: USER and ADMIN.
User can register, login and make orders. Admin can add movies, movie sessions, cinema halls.

Available for **all** roles: /register;

**FOR USER:**

**Get:** /cinema-halls, /movies, /movie-sessions/* , /orders, /shopping-carts;

**Post:** /orders, /shopping-carts;

**FOR ADMIN:**

**Get:** /cinema-halls, /movies, /movie-sessions/**, /users/;

**Post:** /cinema-halls, /movies, /movie-sessions/, /orders/, /shopping-carts;

**Put, Delete:** /movie-sessions/;

# ðŸš© How to run the app
First, clone the repo on GitHub. Second, open Intellij IDEA and open the project. Then configure Tomcat (choose war-exploded artifact).
Also, you have to configure your database properties in 'main/resources/db.properties'.
The next step is to run the app. When you see the login form, you can authorize as ADMIN (admin@test.ua : 1234) or USER (user@test.ua : 1234).
To test the full functionality I advise you to use Postman and sent requests with bodies.

That's all for now. Thanks ðŸ’Ž
